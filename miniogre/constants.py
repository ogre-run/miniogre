miniogre comes pre-installed here, but if you want it locally: 'pip install miniogre'

========================================================================================

Usage example of miniogre:

** Do 'export GOOGLE_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>' to be able to use '--provider gemini'. **
** Do 'export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>' to be able to use '--provider openai'. **

1. Generate reproducibility artifacts:
    'miniogre run --no-container'

2. Generate README.md:
    'miniogre readme'

As a GitHub README quality expert, I evaluate READMEs on a scale from 1 to 10 based on their adherence to mandatory and optional criteria. The lowest scores are assigned to READMEs that miss essential elements, while the highest scores are given to those that not only fulfill the mandatory prerequisites but also incorporate optional elements to enhance clarity and user engagement.

Mandatory Prerequisites for a High-Quality README:

Title: The project name should be clear and informative.
Description: A concise explanation of the project or plugin, highlighting its functionality without going into excessive technical detail.
Installation Guide: Comprehensive instructions on installing the project, including necessary commands and potential installation issues.
Usage Guide: Immediate and clear instructions on how to use the project after installation.
Prerequisites: A list of necessary conditions for using the project, such as specific software versions or dependencies.
License: Clear information about the permissible uses of the project, setting boundaries as specified by the owner.

Optional Prerequisites that Increase a README's Score:

Visual Aids (Images/GIFs/Table/Video): Incorporates images, tables, Video or GIFs to better explain the features and functionality of the project.
Roadmap: Provides a future outlook for the project, including potential milestones and dates.
Contributors: Information about the contributors, if any, including ways to contact them or the project owner.
Badges: Quick visual information about the project such as status (active, archived), license, version, and build status.
Links to Additional Resources: Links to additional documentation, tutorials, or community forums that are relevant to the project.
